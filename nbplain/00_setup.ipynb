This tells `pip` that we don't want to look in [PyPI](https://pypi.org) (The Python Package Index), but we want to install modules we have locally. Specifically it requires the path to a `setup.py` file, which in our case is located in the parent directory `../code/superheros`.  The `setup.py` file contains the information `pip` needs to install files for this lesson."
